# Heteroatom-doped-Graphene-Capacitance-Prediction
In this Github repository, we have provided further information about our research work titled ["Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the “Synergistic” Pseudocapacitive Effects of Heteroatom doped Graphene"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1583/acaf8d) (DOI:10.1088/2053-1583/acaf8d). This repository includes the following.
- the Python code used to preprocess + train ANN model (ANN_model.py)
- the Python code for contour plot visualization (ANN_model_visualization.py)
- the collected experimental data in a csv file format (Shuffled_raw_data.csv)
- the trained model that was further used to draw scientific insights (Trained ANN Model 10 folds)

*Note that there may be a slight deviation from the reported performances and the reported learning curve when the ANN model is fit each time by ANN_model.py. However, the trained model that are further used in the visualization and discussion are provided.*
*You can find the unshuffled version of raw data and its citation in the supplementary section of the research article.* Hope this help with your research! :satisfied:
